Help in Facebook Rate limit problem

Hi 

Im trying to create ads in facebook using python sdk. (15000 ads to be exact)

Im hiting rate limit after I create 10 ads (i.e 10 create-ad requests)

I tried putting delay between each request. (1 second delay)

The error im getting is: message': 'Calls to this api have exceeded the rate limit.', 'code': 613, 'error_subcode': 1487742

I have 1 adaccount, 4 system users

Do you know what delay I should put. Or better, what I should do to avoid rate limit.

It'll be very helpfull to know your experience on this. Like what did you do to solve this problem



Async:

Hi,

Im trying to create lot of ads (15,000) using facebook python sdk. 
But I hit rate limit after creating 11 ads. 
So I was thinking to use async method to create them. 
But I dont know if that will solve my problem also I dont know how exactly to implement it. 
Can you help me by sharing what you did to solve this problem?
